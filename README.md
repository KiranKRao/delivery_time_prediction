# Delivery Time Prediction

## Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a regression model capable of forecasting the delivery time for orders made via **Porter**. The model will leverage various factors including:

- Items in the order  
- Restaurant location  
- Order method  
- Availability of delivery personnel  

### Objectives

- Estimate order delivery time using a range of input variables  
- Enhance prediction accuracy to boost operational performance  
- Identify the major contributors affecting delivery time to refine model precision  

## Tasks Performed

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Imported the dataset for analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Cleaned the data and engineered relevant features to improve model performance

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Explored key patterns, trends, and relationships within the data

4. **Model Building**  
   - Trained regression models to predict delivery times

5. **Results & Inferences**  
   - Evaluated model outputs and extracted meaningful insights

## Conclusion

- `total_outstanding_orders` emerged as the most influential feature on delivery time  
- `total_onshift_dashers` and `distance` had significant effects on predictions  
- Handling outliers contributed to an overall improvement in model performance
